# Contact Form

This project is a simple and responsive contact form created using HTML and CSS. The form allows users to submit their name, email, and a message to my email. I used Web3Forms to handle form submissions.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes using media queries.
- **Stylish Form Elements**: Custom styles for form elements, including hover effects.
- **Third-Party Form Handling**: Uses [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com) to handle form submissions.

## How It Works

The contact form is built with basic HTML elements like `<input>` and `<textarea>`. The CSS is used to style these elements, making them visually appealing and responsive to different devices. The form submits data to Web3Forms using a POST request.

### CSS Highlights

- **Form Styling**: The form is centered and has a modern, clean design with rounded corners and soft colors.
- **Hover Effect**: The submit button has a hover effect to enhance user interaction.
- **Responsive Design**: The form layout adjusts based on screen size to ensure usability on mobile devices.

## Installation

To use this contact form, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Make sure to link the CSS file (`Style.css`) in your HTML.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the contact form in action.
