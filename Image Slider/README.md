## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts for different screen sizes using media queries.
- **Hover Effect**: Enlarges and highlights images when hovered over.
- **Pure CSS Implementation**: Uses only HTML and CSS for functionality.

## How It Works

The image slider is created using a container that holds several images. The CSS applies styles to this container and its child images to make them function as a slider. When an image is hovered over, it enlarges, providing a zoom-in effect while the other images adjust accordingly.

### CSS Highlights

- **Container Styling**: A main container `.container` that centers the content and provides a shadow effect.
- **Image Hover Effect**: The `.img-container img:hover` selector enlarges the image and applies a shadow when the user hovers over it.
- **Responsive Design**: Media queries adjust the size and layout of images for different device sizes.

## Installation

To use this image slider, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Ensure that all image files are located in the `images` directory.
3. Open `index.html` in your web browser to see the image slider in action.
